# Project details
This project was an exercise to convert a csv format file to json format. It involved taking a file as input and converting
it to the proper format through java. This exercise was a fairly simple project, but great hands on work for converting files
to another format. 

# Skills learned with this project.
This project taught me the process of converting a file of one format to another. The skills learned can be used to convert other 
files of different formats to completely new formats in the future. Practicing code such as this is important because it can be used
for many formats with minor adaptation to the code itself.
