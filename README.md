# Project details
This project was assigned to me in my CS310 Software Engineering class. It was an exercise to convert a csv format file to json format. It involved taking a file as input and converting
it to the proper format before exporting it to a file through java. This exercise was a fairly simple project, but great hands on work for converting files
of one type to another format. The program simply loops through and adds all of the data to a json object, and then uses that object to parse the data over to csv, then finally trimming it down in order to properly fit format. Many files can be converted to another type of format, and this convienence can be used to convert old or obscure files to a new format to properly keep things organized.
