# Project details
This project was an exercise to convert a csv format file to json format. It involved taking a file as input and converting
it to the proper format through java. This exercise was a fairly simple project, but great hands on work for converting files
of one type to another format. The program simply loops through and adds all of the data to a json object, and then uses that object to parse the data over to csv, then finally trimming it down in order to properly fit format.
